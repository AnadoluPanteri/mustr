                         Mustr for MeeGo 1.2 Harmattan
                         -----------------------------

 This application can be used to download patterns from COLOURlovers.com and
 set them as lock screen wallpapers. This is basically a simple version of
 Lucas Rocha's "Pattrn" for Android, although I have never used Pattrn myself.
